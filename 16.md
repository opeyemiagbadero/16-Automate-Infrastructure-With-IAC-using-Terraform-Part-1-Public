## Automate Infrastructure With IAC Using Terraform Part 1 ##

After you have built AWS infrastructure for 2 websites manually, it is time to automate the process using Terraform.

For easier authentication configuration – use AWS CLI with aws configure command.

Create an S3 bucket to store Terraform state file.

Created a folder called PBL, and a file in the folder, named main.tf Added AWS as a provider, and a resource to create a VPC in the main.tf file.
Provider block informs Terraform that we intend to build an infrastructure within AWS.
Add the code below into the main.tf file

The next thing we need to do, is to download necessary plugins for Terraform to work. These plugins are used by providers and provisioners. At this stage, we only have provider in our main.tf file. So, Terraform will just download plugin for AWS provider

Observations:

Notice that a new directory has been created: .terraform\.... This is where Terraform keeps plugins. Generally, it is safe to delete this folder. It just means that you must execute terraform init again, to download them.

A new file is created terraform.tfstate This is how Terraform keeps itself up to date with the exact state of the infrastructure. It reads this file to know what already exists, what should be added, or destroyed based on the entire terraform code that is being developed.
If you also observed closely, you would realise that another file gets created during planning and apply. But this file gets deleted immediately. terraform.tfstate.lock.info This is what Terraform uses to track, who is running its code against the infrastructure at any point in time. This is very important for teams working on the same Terraform repository at the same time. The lock prevents a user from executing Terraform configuration against the same infrastructure when another user is doing the same – it allows to avoid duplicates and conflicts.


According to our architectural design, we require 6 subnets:

2 public
2 private for webservers
2 private for data layer
Let us create the first 2 public subnets.

Add below configuration to the main.tf file:

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/200131808-f0113be4-d8d3-4b13-873b-9582c6a1b624.png)

We are creating 2 subnets, therefore declaring 2 resource blocks – one for each of the subnets.
We are using the vpc_id argument to interpolate the value of the VPC id by setting it to aws_vpc.main.id. This way, Terraform knows inside which VPC to create the subnet.
Run terraform plan and terraform apply

Observations:

Hard coded values: Remember our best practice hint from the beginning? Both the availability_zone and cidr_block arguments are hard coded. We should always endeavour to make our work dynamic.
Multiple Resource Blocks: Notice that we have declared multiple resource blocks for each subnet in the code. This is bad coding practice. We need to create a single resource block that can dynamically create resources without specifying multiple blocks. Imagine if we wanted to create 10 subnets, our code would look very clumsy. So, we need to optimize this by introducing a count argument.
The configuration shold look like the snapshot below in the main.tf file after refactoring

Instead of havng a long lisf of variables in main.tf file, we can actually make our code a lot more readable and better structured by moving out some parts of the configuration content to other files. We will create two additonal files, the variables.tf file and the terraform.tfvars file.

The variables.tf consist of all variable declarations in the main.tf file. The terraform.tfvars file set values for each of the variables.

The variable.tf file will have the HCL configuration below

and the main.tf file

You should also have this file structure in the PBL folder.

Run terraform plan to ensure all configuration is not showing any error and run terraform apply.

Confirm that the infrastructure which consists of the VPC and the subnets have been built on AWS
